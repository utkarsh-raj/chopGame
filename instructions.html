	<h3>Rules to Play Chopsticks:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The motive is to nullify both hands of your opponent. A hand is "dead" when all 5 fingers are opened.</li>
		<li>Game start with players with each having one finger out.</li>
		<li>One person starts by using one of his hands to touch any other person's hand.</li>
		<li>The person he touches adds up the number of fingers involved (sum of number of fingers in his hand and the hand which touched him).</li>
		<li><strong>Divide:</strong> When its your turn and you have both of your hands alive, you can <strong>divide</strong>. In this, number of fingers in you hand will be added and then divided equally (if the sum is odd <em>i.e.</em> 5 it will be divided into 2 and 3).</li>
		<li>If the sum comes out to be more than 5 <em>i.e.</em> 7, the total is subtracted by 5 which leaves 2 fingers extended.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions for Playing</h3>
	<ul>
